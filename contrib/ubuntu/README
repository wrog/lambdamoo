Ubuntu support for LambdaMOO
----------------------------

INSTALLATION

* Build LambdaMOO, following the instructions in the README
* Install `moo` to `/usr/local/bin/moo`
* Install `moo-server` to `/usr/local/bin/moo-service`
* Install `moo.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/moo.service`
* Create a `moo` user and group, and give ownership of `/var/local/moo` to it (I
  use `adduser --in-group --system moo` for this)
* Run `systemctl enable moo.service` to start LambdaMOO on boot
* Run `systemctl start moo.service` to start LambdaMOO immediately

FILES AND DIRECTORIES

This configuration stores its brains in `/var/local/moo`, in three files:

* `recovery.db` is last booted DB.
* `boot.db` is the database used to bootstrap the server. On boot, it will be
  copied to `recovery.db` if it exists.
* `snapshot.db` is the snapshot produced by the server as it runs. On boot, it
  will be copied to `boot.db` if it exists.

By default, the server will listen on port 7777. Setting `MOO_PORT`, either in
`moo.service` or in `/etc/default/moo-server`, will configure the server to
listen on another port.
